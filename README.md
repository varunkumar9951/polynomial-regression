This project demonstrates how to perform *Polynomial Regression* using scikit-learn with synthetic sample data.

## ðŸ“Œ What is Polynomial Regression?

Polynomial Regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable X and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial.

## ðŸ§¾ Code Description

### ðŸ”§ Libraries Used
- numpy for numerical operations
- matplotlib for plotting
- scikit-learn for model training and polynomial feature transformation
